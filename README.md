Interpreting user needs and translating them into a program through stories helps give a better understanding as to what the user is seeking to achieve. Approaching all requests from an end user point of view rather than a solution-based or technical approach. This identifies exactly what is trying to be achieved, establishing requirements and categorizing them based on the goal of the program. Establishing the correct technique to go about gathering requirements as well as translating them into clear, short, and concise user stories tasks. Having as many discussions as possible about what, who, and how the program will be delivered including requirements and method of execution. Noting the users’ needs in a well-formatted layout or in a criteria list based on importance will help process interpretation which will include feasibility studies, requirement gatherings, creating a business requirement documentation, a software requirement specification document, as well as validation of the requirements. The user requirements that will be listed will address and detail all aspects of the program by writing and documenta ting aspects to determine the best project plan. The process flows diagram and showing basic features of the program is developed with minimal features that details steps from beginning to end. Additionally, discussions for verifications on any features and enhancements based on priorities.

Having a user’s story provides a basis of communication and collaboration focusing on establishing cross-team clarity on importance into what is needed to be built. This also emphasizes verbal communication, especially in the requirements gathering processes. It is a formal and simple way to translate ideas, requests and complex issues, intended features, to be integrated into the project. Utilizing the Agile Software Development Life Cycle delivers value back to the end user as well as describing parts or features of a software in a way they empower meaningful product discussions within the agile team. User stories help deviate from writing about requirements to discussions about them. It also reduces the time spent on writing large documents as well as a time saver in developing quality software. It is simply a conversation channel between the client and the development team. 

The best approach for developing programs is having a clear picture of what to build, for who, the purpose, and approximately when it will be implemented. Being able to use the right development methodology based on the nature and scope of the project helps to drive the true value, eliminate delays, minimize risks such as going over budget, bugs, and drastic changing requirements. A process of unambiguous requirement gathering before any kind of software development process begins should also already be in place. The development team should be empowered to decide the software development model that is best suited for the development process. The commonly used models include iterative, waterfall, prototype, and agile among others.

A general agile software development process has five common methods used in software development they are Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, Lean Development, and Crystal. Over this course, with all the material learned scrum is the one method that incorporates all the aspects that make a software development project successful. Scrum embraces a feature driven development, frequent inspections, and adaptation more than most agile methods. This encourages accountability, teamwork, self-organization, and learning through experience and it is aligned towards a business approach where external stakeholders are included in all development processes.
